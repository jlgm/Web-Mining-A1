You should not use oxycodone if you have severe asthma or breathing problems, or a blockage in your stomach or intestines.
Oxycodone can slow or stop your breathing, especially when you start using this medicine or whenever your dose is changed. Never take this medicine in larger amounts, or for longer than prescribed. Do not crush, break, or open an extended-release pill (Oxycontin). Swallow it whole to avoid exposure to a potentially fatal dose.
Oxycodone may be habit-forming, even at regular doses. Take this medicine exactly as prescribed by your doctor. Never share the medicine with another person.
