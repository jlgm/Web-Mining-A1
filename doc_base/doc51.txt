Generic Name: duloxetine (du LOX e teen)Brand Names: Cymbalta
Cymbalta (duloxetine) is a selective serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor antidepressant (SSNRI). The way duloxetine works is still not fully understood. It is thought to positively affect communication between nerve cells in the central nervous system and/or restore chemical balance in the brain.
Cymbalta is used to treat major depressive disorder in adults. It is also used to treat general anxiety disorder in adults and children who are at least 7 years old.
Cymbalta is also used in adults to treat fibromyalgia (a chronic pain disorder), or chronic muscle or joint pain (such as low back pain and osteoarthritis pain).
Cymbalta is also used to treat pain caused by nerve damage in adults with diabetes (diabetic neuropathy).
You should not use Cymbalta if you have untreated or uncontrolled glaucoma, or if you also take thioridazine.
Do not use Cymbalta if you have used an MAO inhibitor in the past 14 days. A dangerous drug interaction could occur. MAO inhibitors include isocarboxazid, linezolid, methylene blue injection, phenelzine, rasagiline, selegiline, tranylcypromine, and others. After you stop taking Cymbalta, you must wait at least 5 days before you start taking an MAOI.
