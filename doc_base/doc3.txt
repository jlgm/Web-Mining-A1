Generic Name: spironolactone (spir ON oh LAK tone)Brand Names: Aldactone
Spironolactone is a potassium-sparing diuretic (water pill) that prevents your body from absorbing too much salt and keeps your potassium levels from getting too low.
Spironolactone is used to diagnose or treat a condition in which you have too much aldosterone in your body. Aldosterone is a hormone produced by your adrenal glands to help regulate the salt and water balance in your body.
Spironolactone also treats fluid retention (edema) in people with congestive heart failure, cirrhosis of the liver, or a kidney disorder called nephrotic syndrome. This medication is also used to treat or prevent hypokalemia (low potassium levels in the blood).
Spironolactone may also be used for purposes not listed in this medication guide.
You should not use spironolactone if you have kidney disease, high levels of potassium in your blood, Addison's disease (an adrenal gland disorder), if you are unable to urinate, or if you are also taking eplerenone.
In animal studies, spironolactone caused certain types of cancers or tumors. It is not known whether these effects would occur in people using this medicine. Ask your doctor about your risk.
