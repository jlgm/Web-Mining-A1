Imodium (loperamide) slows the rhythm of digestion so that the small intestines have more time to absorb fluid and nutrients from the foods you eat.
Imodium is used to treat diarrhea.
Imodium is also used to reduce the amount of stool in people who have an ileostomy (re-routing of the bowel through a surgical opening in the stomach).
You should not use Imodium if you have stomach pain without diarrhea, ulcerative colitis, bloody or tarry stools, diarrhea with a high fever, or diarrhea that is caused by a bacterial infection or by taking antibiotic medicine.
Do not take more than the recommended dose of this medicine. Misuse of loperamide can cause serious heart problems that could be fatal.
Imodium can also cause a serious heart problem if you use certain medicines at the same time. Ask a doctor or pharmacist if it is safe for you to use this medicine if you are also taking other medications.
