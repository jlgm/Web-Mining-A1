Generic Name: sertraline (SER tra leen)Brand Names: Zoloft
Sertraline is an antidepressant in a group of drugs called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs).
The way this medicine works is still not fully understood. It is thought to positively affect communication between nerve cells in the central nervous system and/or restore chemical balance in the brain.
Sertraline is used to treat depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, panic disorder, anxiety disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD).
You should not use sertraline if you also take pimozide, or if you are being treated with methylene blue injection.
Do not use sertraline if you have taken an MAO inhibitor in the past 14 days. A dangerous drug interaction could occur. MAO inhibitors include isocarboxazid, linezolid, phenelzine, rasagiline, selegiline, and tranylcypromine.
Some young people have thoughts about suicide when first taking an antidepressant. Stay alert to changes in your mood or symptoms. Report any new or worsening symptoms to your doctor.
