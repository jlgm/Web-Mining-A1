Generic Name: adapalene and benzoyl peroxide (topical) (a DAP a leen and BEN zoyl per OX ide)Brand Names: Epiduo
Epiduo gel contains a combination of adapalene and benzoyl peroxide. Adapalene is similar to vitamin A. It helps the skin renew itself. Benzoyl peroxide has an antibacterial effect. It also has a mild drying effect, which allows excess oils and dirt to be easily washed away from the skin.
Epiduo gel is used to treat acne vulgaris (severe acne) in people who are at least 9 years old.
Before using Epiduo gel, tell your doctor about all other medicated skin products you are using. Using more than one acne medication at a time could cause severe skin irritation.
Avoid getting Epiduo gel in your mouth, nose, or eyes, or on your lips. If it does get into any of these areas, rinse with water. Do not use Epiduo gel on sunburned, windburned, dry, chapped, irritated, or broken skin. Also avoid using Epiduo gel on wounds or on areas of eczema. Wait until these conditions have healed before using this medication.
Benzoyl peroxide can cause a rare but serious allergic reaction or severe skin irritation. Stop using this medicine and get emergency medical help if you have: hives, itching; difficult breathing, feeling light-headed; or swelling of your face, lips, tongue, or throat.
Avoid using skin products that can cause dryness or irritation, such as harsh soaps, shampoos, or skin cleansers, hair removers or waxes, or skin products with alcohol, spices, astringents, or lime.
