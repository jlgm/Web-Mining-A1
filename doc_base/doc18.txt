Tetracycline is an antibiotic that fights infection caused by bacteria.
Tetracycline is used to treat many different bacterial infections of the skin, intestines, respiratory tract, urinary tract, genitals, lymph nodes, and other body systems. It is often used in treating severe acne, or sexually transmitted diseases such as syphilis, gonorrhea, or chlamydia.
Tetracycline is also used to treat infections you can get from direct contact with infected animals or contaminated food.
In some cases, tetracycline is used when penicillin or another antibiotic cannot be used to treat serious infections such as Anthrax, Listeria, Clostridium, Actinomyces, and others.
Children younger than 8 years old should not take this medicine.
Using tetracycline during pregnancy could harm the unborn baby or cause permanent tooth discoloration later in the baby's life.
