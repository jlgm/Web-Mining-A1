Intermezzo (zolpidem) is a sedative, also called a hypnotic. It affects chemicals in your brain that may become unbalanced and cause sleep problems (insomnia).
Intermezzo sublingual tablets are used to treat insomnia characterized by middle-of-the-night waking followed by difficulty returning to sleep.
Intermezzo should only be used when a person has at least four hours of bedtime remaining. It should not be taken if alcohol has been consumed or with any other sleep aid.
Do not share Intermezzo with another person, even if they have the same symptoms you have. The recommended doses of Intermezzo are not the same in men and women, and this drug is not approved for use in children. Misuse of this medication can result in dangerous side effects.
Intermezzo may impair your thinking or reactions. You may still feel sleepy the morning after taking Intermezzo, especially if you are a woman. Wait at least 4 hours or until you are fully awake before you do anything that requires you to be awake and alert.
Some people using this medicine have engaged in activity such as driving, eating, walking, making phone calls, or having sex and later having no memory of the activity. If this happens to you, stop taking Intermezzo and talk with your doctor about another treatment for your sleep disorder.
