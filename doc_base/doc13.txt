Solodyn (minocycline) is a tetracycline antibiotic supplied as an extended release tablet.
Solodyn is a prescription medicine used to treat pimples and red bumps (non-nodular inflammatory lesions) that happen with moderate to severe acne vulgaris in people 12 years and older.
Solodyn is not effective for acne that is not red-looking (this means acne that is not inflammatory).
Do not use Solodyn if you are pregnant. It could harm the unborn baby or cause permanent tooth discoloration later in life.
Solodyn can make birth control pills less effective. Ask your doctor about using a non hormone method of birth control (such as a condom, diaphragm, spermicide) to prevent pregnancy while using Solodyn.
Minocycline passes into breast milk and may affect bone and tooth development in a nursing baby. Do not take Solodyn without telling your doctor if you are breast-feeding a baby. Children should not take this medication. Minocycline can cause permanent yellowing or graying of the teeth in children younger than 8 years old.
