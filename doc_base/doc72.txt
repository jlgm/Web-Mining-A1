Remeron (mirtazapine) is an antidepressant. The way mirtazapine works is still not fully understood. It is thought to positively affect communication between nerve cells in the central nervous system and/or restore chemical balance in the brain.
Remeron is used to treat major depressive disorder.
Remeron may also be used for purposes not listed in this medication guide.
You should not take Remeron if you are also taking tryptophan (sometimes called L-tryptophan).
Do not use Remeron if you have used an MAO inhibitor in the past 14 days. A dangerous drug interaction could occur. MAO inhibitors include isocarboxazid, linezolid, methylene blue injection, phenelzine, rasagiline, selegiline, tranylcypromine, and others.
Some young people have thoughts about suicide when first taking an antidepressant. Your doctor will need to check your progress at regular visits while you are using Remeron. Your family or other caregivers should also be alert to changes in your mood or symptoms.
